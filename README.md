## Use Technology:
**Locomotive Lib feature:**

*Scroll-hijacking is a controversial practice that can cause usability, accessibility, and performance issues. Please use responsibly.*
- each time Locomotive Scroll updates, tell ScrollTrigger to update too (sync positioning)
- tell ScrollTrigger to use these scrollerProxy methods for the "#main" element since Locomotive Scroll is hijacking things
- Image Animation.
